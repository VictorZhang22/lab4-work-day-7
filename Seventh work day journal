Seventh entry (extra workday) (23/1/2021 8:00pm – 8:43pm (43 minutes)):
Today I completed problem 8, which is the last problem in this lab. When I started working on this problem last time, I thought that it would make sense if I set the 1000-digit number an integer. But last night, when I was lying in bed thinking, I realized that in Lab2, where I spliced the DNA sequences, the sequences were strings. I quickly jot the idea down and today when I was working, I entered the 1000-digit number as a string. Then, I was able to splice the string into groups of 13 or less. I appended all of them to a list. I created a function that calculates the product of the elements in the integers. I was going to use np.prod, but it does not work on strings. So afterwards I appended all of the products into a new list, and used the max() function to select the greatest number. 
I’m very happy that I put in an extra workday to finish the program because not only was the experience very satisfying but also very inspiring. I learnt a lot of new skills during the process and I practiced a lot.
